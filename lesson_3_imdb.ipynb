              "'This is a extremely well-made film. The acting, script and camera-work are all first-rate. The music is good, too, though it is mostly early in the film, when things are still relatively cheery. There are no really superstars in the cast, though several faces will be familiar. The entire cast does an excellent job with the script.<br /><br />But it is hard to watch, because there is no good end to a situation like the one presented. It is now fashionable to blame the British for setting Hindus and Muslims against each other, and then cruelly separating them into two countries. There is some merit in this view, but it\\'s also true that no one forced Hindus and Muslims in the region to mistreat each other as they did around the time of partition. It seems more likely that the British simply saw the tensions between the religions and were clever enough to exploit them to their own ends.<br /><br />The result is that there is much cruelty and inhumanity in the situation and this is very unpleasant to remember and to see on the screen. But it is never painted as a black-and-white case. There is baseness and nobility on both sides, and also the hope for change in the younger generation.<br /><br />There is redemption of a sort, in the end, when Puro has to make a hard choice between a man who has ruined her life, but also truly loved her, and her family which has disowned her, then later come looking for her. But by that point, she has no option that is without great pain for her.<br /><br />This film carries the message that both Muslims and Hindus have their grave faults, and also that both can be dignified and caring people. The reality of partition makes that realisation all the more wrenching, since there can never be real reconciliation across the India/Pakistan border. In that sense, it is similar to \"Mr & Mrs Iyer\".<br /><br />In the end, we were glad to have seen the film, even though the resolution was heartbreaking. If the UK and US could deal with their own histories of racism with this kind of frankness, they would certainly be better off.'"

              "  xxmaj if you like xxmaj maria de xxmaj medeiros here and in xxmaj pulp xxmaj fiction , then seek out the small xxmaj spanish , xxmaj film xxmaj xxunk .,xxbos xxmaj this was a film that got a rather high score in the xxmaj leonard xxmaj maltin xxmaj guide -- saying the film was \" still potent \" . xxmaj well , i was excited about seeing it , as i love xxmaj american xxup wwii propaganda films and have seen a huge number of them . xxmaj unfortunately , while the original stage production of the play and the subsequent movie made quite a splash , the whole thing seems terribly dated and poorly written today . xxmaj the bottom line is that the film lacks subtlety and has plot holes big enough to fly a xxup b-17 through them ! xxmaj the movie begins well enough , as xxmaj frederic xxmaj march ( a fine actor ) is in the lead . xxmaj but my hopes were soon dashed when the little xxmaj nazi boy ( xxmaj emil ) comes to live with them . xxmaj first , it 's hard to imagine the xxmaj nazis letting a boy leave the country to come to the xxup us while we are at war with them ! xxmaj secondly , it 's hard to imagine the xxup us government just accepting the kid without making sure he was n't a spy or an xxmaj america - hater . xxmaj but regardless , here appears a 12 year - old boy who often sounds quite xxmaj german ( he uses xxmaj german and xxmaj english xxunk ) but his accent also wavers a bit -- almost sounding xxmaj swedish or xxmaj polish from time to time . i guess you ca n't blame him that much , as this is a xxup very demanding role for a young boy . xxmaj but who you can blame are the writers who immediately throw subtlety out the window . xxmaj instead of the kid pretending to love xxmaj america or creating trust with his new family , he immediately acts like the local chairman of the xxmaj hitler fan club -- even showing up to his first meal dressed in full xxmaj hitler xxmaj youth regalia ( including an armband ) . xxmaj now i do n't know about you , but if i 'd been alive during the war and a kid moved in with me and preceded to parade around the house in xxmaj nazi uniform spouting hate , i think i 'd be a bit peeved ! xxmaj but , xxmaj march and the rest try to show him understanding instead of turning the brat over to the xxup fbi ! ! xxmaj plus , while xxmaj march works on top - secret military plans , he does a lousy job of securing them so xxmaj emil is n't able to steal them . xxmaj also , you 'd think when he went to school and began spreading hate and xxmaj nazi propaganda that the school would have taken more notice . xxmaj no trip to the principal 's office , no phone calls home and no contact with the local police . xxmaj it just defies all common sense to think that during the war anyone would have been allowed to act this way without being arrested is crazy . xxmaj america xxup does have freedom of speech , but for a foreign national spreading pro - xxmaj nazi propaganda during the war , this is ridiculous ! xxmaj now if this was the only problem with the film , i guess you could chalk it up to naiveté . xxmaj unfortunately , it got a lot worse . xxmaj emil spread anger and dissent everywhere but no one actually did anything about this ... so far , so good . xxup but , after 1001 warning signs xxup and when he then tries to kill two people ( by beating one with a fireplace poker and then trying to stab another ) , you 'd think the kid would have been deported or arrested or even shot ! xxmaj but , in one of the worst endings in film history , they stupid family feels sorry for the kid and decides , like the xxmaj beatles once said , \" all you need is love \" . xxmaj to make matters worse , the girl who was beaten with the poker was xxmaj march 's own kid and the lady who convinces xxmaj march not to press charges in the end was his xxmaj jewish fiancée ! ! xxmaj yecch ! ! ! xxmaj what drivel . xxmaj the film just does n't make sense and becomes tiresome because of all this .,xxbos xxmaj say what you like about a good independent movie or a good b - movie but to me , a good film like xxup acne , beats a decent $ 80 million dollar film every time . xxmaj yes , the acting is n't as professional with this film , but that adds a certain realism . xxmaj yes , the sets are n't always picture perfect but whose house or office is ? xxup acne is a horror movie for 2005 and beyond . xxmaj the threats to the main characters are as real as what people face everyday around our planet . xxmaj pollution , exploitation , manipulation , false promises , disease and disfigurement but it does so with a twisted black comic heart and believe me , you 're going to laugh ( with the movie ) .\n",

              "  xxmaj if you like xxmaj maria de xxmaj medeiros here and in xxmaj pulp xxmaj fiction , then seek out the small xxmaj spanish , xxmaj film xxmaj xxunk .,xxbos xxmaj this was a film that got a rather high score in the xxmaj leonard xxmaj maltin xxmaj guide -- saying the film was \" still potent \" . xxmaj well , i was excited about seeing it , as i love xxmaj american xxup wwii propaganda films and have seen a huge number of them . xxmaj unfortunately , while the original stage production of the play and the subsequent movie made quite a splash , the whole thing seems terribly dated and poorly written today . xxmaj the bottom line is that the film lacks subtlety and has plot holes big enough to fly a xxup b-17 through them ! xxmaj the movie begins well enough , as xxmaj frederic xxmaj march ( a fine actor ) is in the lead . xxmaj but my hopes were soon dashed when the little xxmaj nazi boy ( xxmaj emil ) comes to live with them . xxmaj first , it 's hard to imagine the xxmaj nazis letting a boy leave the country to come to the xxup us while we are at war with them ! xxmaj secondly , it 's hard to imagine the xxup us government just accepting the kid without making sure he was n't a spy or an xxmaj america - hater . xxmaj but regardless , here appears a 12 year - old boy who often sounds quite xxmaj german ( he uses xxmaj german and xxmaj english xxunk ) but his accent also wavers a bit -- almost sounding xxmaj swedish or xxmaj polish from time to time . i guess you ca n't blame him that much , as this is a xxup very demanding role for a young boy . xxmaj but who you can blame are the writers who immediately throw subtlety out the window . xxmaj instead of the kid pretending to love xxmaj america or creating trust with his new family , he immediately acts like the local chairman of the xxmaj hitler fan club -- even showing up to his first meal dressed in full xxmaj hitler xxmaj youth regalia ( including an armband ) . xxmaj now i do n't know about you , but if i 'd been alive during the war and a kid moved in with me and preceded to parade around the house in xxmaj nazi uniform spouting hate , i think i 'd be a bit peeved ! xxmaj but , xxmaj march and the rest try to show him understanding instead of turning the brat over to the xxup fbi ! ! xxmaj plus , while xxmaj march works on top - secret military plans , he does a lousy job of securing them so xxmaj emil is n't able to steal them . xxmaj also , you 'd think when he went to school and began spreading hate and xxmaj nazi propaganda that the school would have taken more notice . xxmaj no trip to the principal 's office , no phone calls home and no contact with the local police . xxmaj it just defies all common sense to think that during the war anyone would have been allowed to act this way without being arrested is crazy . xxmaj america xxup does have freedom of speech , but for a foreign national spreading pro - xxmaj nazi propaganda during the war , this is ridiculous ! xxmaj now if this was the only problem with the film , i guess you could chalk it up to naiveté . xxmaj unfortunately , it got a lot worse . xxmaj emil spread anger and dissent everywhere but no one actually did anything about this ... so far , so good . xxup but , after 1001 warning signs xxup and when he then tries to kill two people ( by beating one with a fireplace poker and then trying to stab another ) , you 'd think the kid would have been deported or arrested or even shot ! xxmaj but , in one of the worst endings in film history , they stupid family feels sorry for the kid and decides , like the xxmaj beatles once said , \" all you need is love \" . xxmaj to make matters worse , the girl who was beaten with the poker was xxmaj march 's own kid and the lady who convinces xxmaj march not to press charges in the end was his xxmaj jewish fiancée ! ! xxmaj yecch ! ! ! xxmaj what drivel . xxmaj the film just does n't make sense and becomes tiresome because of all this .,xxbos xxmaj say what you like about a good independent movie or a good b - movie but to me , a good film like xxup acne , beats a decent $ 80 million dollar film every time . xxmaj yes , the acting is n't as professional with this film , but that adds a certain realism . xxmaj yes , the sets are n't always picture perfect but whose house or office is ? xxup acne is a horror movie for 2005 and beyond . xxmaj the threats to the main characters are as real as what people face everyday around our planet . xxmaj pollution , exploitation , manipulation , false promises , disease and disfigurement but it does so with a twisted black comic heart and believe me , you 're going to laugh ( with the movie ) .\n",
